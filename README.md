# Bookmarker-site
In this site hasincluded a Site Bookmark app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will help us to store links to our favorite websites without working with any database, and just using the local storage of our browser.

Local Storage is known as the web storage API and allows us to store data on the client-side. Data in local storage is stored in form of strings and persists even after closing the session.  Data can only be removed if the user manually deletes it.  All the data stays on the client-side, thus there is a defined limitation regarding the length of the values, and we can currently store from 2 MB to 10 MB size of data depending upon the browser we use.

Approach: The Bookmark App which we are designing can do the following:

Add a new bookmark with the userâ€™s typed name and a website link.
Contain option of visiting the website
Deleting the bookmark
Then always save the bookmarks permanently on LocalStorage
